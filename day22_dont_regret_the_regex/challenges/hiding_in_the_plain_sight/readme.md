Me and my friends always play hide and seek games when we were young (ahh the good old times), but then we got older, and most of us got a really good job but its taking too much of our times and we cant even play together again anymore :(

I remember that we have buried a secret near my house when we played a game about something back then, but its really hard to get the secret because we didnt bury it inside a sand or something, but instead we bury it inside of so many text lol

Please find our secret because i really need it to feel about those days again...

What i remember about the secret is that :

- it doesnt consist of any kind of emoji
- there is a text before "{" but there is no text after "}"
- there are no symbols except "_", "!", "{" and "}"
- same symbols can only comes 3 times in a row at most, ex: "+++" is correct but "++++++" is not
- there are only number 0 and 4
