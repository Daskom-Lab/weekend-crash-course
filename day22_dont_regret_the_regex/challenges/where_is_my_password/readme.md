I cant find my password, i accidently paste so many garbage strings into my password keeper note, and now i've lost my password :(
Please help me because i heard that you are a regex master :D

I think my password consist of all digits, separated with a dash between each digit but because im a unique (or rather strange) kind of person, i made it exactly 25 digits, it looks like this if you are confused :

1-1-1-1-1... (until 25 digits)

But i cant seem to find something that match my password constraint in the text file :(( help me please
