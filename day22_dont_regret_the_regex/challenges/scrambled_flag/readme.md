I am a really good person so i want to give you the flag directly, but somehow there is an accident, a cat suddenly leap onto my keyboard and click a bunch of keys thus scrambling the flag XD

I noticed this accidentally-created pattern in the scrambled flag :

- if there is "+" before a character it means the character is incorrect character flag, ex: "+p", "+_"
- similarly, if there is "-" after a character it means the character is incorrect character flag, ex: "p-", "_-"
- if there is "!" after a character it means that the character have to be change to "i", ex: "A!" have to be converted to "i"
- if there is "%" after a character it means that the character have to be change to "f", ex: "A%" have to be converted to "f"
- if there is "$" after a character it means that the character have to be change to "g", ex: "A$" have to be converted to "g"
- a number character is correct if and only if its followed by character "X", ex: "1X"

Im really sorry for this thing, but what worse is that i couldn't fix the flag for you, so you have to fix it yourself, again, im sorry 🙏
