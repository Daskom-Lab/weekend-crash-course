I've always wanted to go abroad since i was a child, and now that i've gone abroad (sillicon valley to be exact) for too long times, i kind of forgot about my home address (strange right, i know), im so stupid and too embarrassed to ask my parents for this thing, please help me find my home address...

Only thing i still remember about my home address is that :

- i live in jalan "...lama"
- my home address is not in kabupaten
- my house number match my postal code, ex: if my house number is 40329 then my postal code is 40329 like "... No.40329 ... Jawa Barat 40329"
- also i really remember this fun little fact that my RT number is the same as my RW number :v
- and you know what, my home address just never have a kelurahan, i dont know why

Please please please just tell me where my home address is because i really cant tell myself where, and now i cant go back home :((
