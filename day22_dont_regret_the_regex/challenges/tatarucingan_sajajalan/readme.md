**Tatarucingan sajajalan is sundanese for never ending puzzle**

My friend gave me a puzzle that is pretty easy to understand but not quite that easy to actually crack it and get the flag out of the puzzle, so heres how it works :

we are given a regex pattern that will only match one single string (with a lot of characters of course) and then this string turns out to be something that we can later decode to become another regex pattern that we have to find a single string that could match this pattern, on and on it goes (hence tatarucingan sajajalan) until we got the flag...

Easy right ? but i cant do it lol, so please help me to get the flag

Note from chall author so you can learn sundanese while hacking :D
